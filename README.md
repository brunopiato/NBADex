# NBA Players Dex

The NBA Players Dex is an app in which the NBA fan can visualize and inspect some data about their favorite player, comparing different player to visually access their similarity.

It can be acessed in this link: https://brunopiato-nbadex--home-ema0lf.streamlit.app/

I strongly recommend you to use the dark theme (`Settings >> Theme >> Dark`) so the colors of the charts match more elegantly.

## The main goal
Providing the NBA fan community with an easy and simple way to interact and inspect NBA.

## NBA Players Dex content

    - Note that the values inside the radar charts are 
    standardized according to the maximum for each feature
    in the dataset. It means that a value of 0.3 is equivalent 
    of 30% of the maximumfor that feature, while a value of 1.0 
    is the maximum value itselt.
    - If you want to check the real values for each feature it 
    is presented at the end of the page 

### Features to be implemented in the future
